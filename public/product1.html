            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>I was feeling frustrated as I headed to my psychologist's office for what I believe was my sixth session. <br> 
                It was hot, and I was gliding through the city streets on my skateboard, my mind weighed down. <br> 
                At home, I had just finished the base of a new artwork, but I couldn’t grasp its meaning, nor could I understand why my mind and hands had created something so mysterious. <br> 
                When I arrived at the studio, overheated, I exchanged cordial greetings and rolled up my sleeves. <br> 
                The psychologist noticed my tattoos: a snake with two heads. She asked me what it represented. <br><br> 
                
                I replied, "In life, I’ve learned to live with who I am and who I need to be in society. <br> 
                The ink on my skin is my art, like ghosts moving in the shadows of my body, two minds battling to take hold of reality." <br> 
                We continued talking about my tattoos, one by one, until she noticed my frustration. <br><br> 
                
                "What’s going on?" she asked. <br><br>
                
                "I started a piece today, but I can't figure out its meaning. <br> 
                It feels like my emotions and my expressive abilities are being held back by the limits I’ve imposed on myself, to avoid getting hurt by the outside world." <br><br> 
                
                I described the artwork to her: a sheet of das covering woven sheets of paper, writings, words, and dates. <br> 
                My thoughts, as if suffocated under a blanket. A blanket that won’t let them out. <br><br> 
                
                "An oppressive blanket," she responded. <br><br> 
                
                "Yes, but it should only protect me, not suffocate me," I immediately replied. <br> 
                "It’s like I’ve fallen into a pool of oil, struggling and screaming, but unable to get out." <br><br> 
                
                There was a long silence, which she abruptly broke: "You can’t do that! <br> 
                You can’t put everything you feel under a blanket. <br> 
                There is no emotion without its negative counterpart, no passion without hate…" <br><br> 
                
                I continued, "I’ve put all of myself under a blanket soaked in oil, and now I can’t breathe." <br><br> 
                
                That day, I decided to remove the blanket, and this is what came of it. <br> 
                I thought a life without risks would be better, but I’ve discovered that a life without risk is not life.
